## Background Information

**Bellabeat** is a high-tech company founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur in 2013, specializing in health-focused smart products designed for women. Leveraging Sršen's background as an artist, Bellabeat has created beautifully designed technology that empowers women by providing insights into their health and habits, including activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health data.

Since its inception, Bellabeat has grown rapidly, opening offices worldwide and launching a variety of products. The company has expanded its reach through online retailers and its own e-commerce platform. Bellabeat utilizes both traditional advertising methods and a strong digital marketing strategy, focusing on Google Search, social media engagement, and video ads to connect with consumers.

Bellabeat's marketing efforts are driven by data, and the company is keen to analyze user behavior and trends in smart device usage. Sršen has tasked the marketing analytics team with analyzing consumer data to uncover opportunities for growth and to inform future marketing strategies.

### Business Task

Sršen requests an analysis of smart device usage data to understand how consumers use non-Bellabeat devices. Based on these insights, she asks for a focus on one Bellabeat product in the presentation. This case study will address the following questions:

1.  What are some trends in smart device usage?
2.  How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3.  How can these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
